* My Emacs Config

For a number of reasons I've decided to abandon Spacemacs in favour of my own,
lighter configuration, including my attempt to manage my =.spacemacs= file with
~org-tangle~. This is the result so far of several hours spent on a weekend
learning how to put an Emacs config together.
